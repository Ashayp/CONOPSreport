\section{Background, objectives, and scope \label{Section::Backgroundobjectivesandscope}}
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item Multi-store support: The system will support multiple stores, allowing store managers and staff to manage inventory across multiple locations. This will provide centralized inventory control and enable inventory transfers between stores.

    \item Mobile access: The system will provide mobile access, allowing store managers and staff to access inventory data and perform inventory management tasks from anywhere at any time. This will enable remote inventory management and reduce the need for physical presence in the store.

    \item Customizable alerts: The system will enable customizable alerts that notify store managers and staff of low inventory levels, stockouts, and other inventory-related issues. Alerts can be customized to specific thresholds and sent via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.

    \item Integration with POS system: The system will integrate with the point-of-sale (POS) system, allowing inventory levels to be automatically updated based on sales transactions. This will ensure accurate inventory tracking and reduce errors related to manual data entry.

    \item Vendor management: The system will include vendor management functionality, allowing store managers and staff to manage vendor relationships and track vendor performance. This will help optimize the purchasing process and ensure timely delivery of goods.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Operational policies and constraints \label{Section::Operationalpoliciesandconstraints}}
\textbf{Operational policies}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Access control: Access to the instore inventory management system will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Access credentials will be assigned on a need-to-know basis.

    \item Data protection: The system will store inventory data in a secure and encrypted manner. Data backups will be taken regularly to ensure data integrity and availability in case of system failure.

    \item Maintenance and support: The system will be maintained and supported by trained personnel to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Maintenance schedules will be developed to minimize disruptions to store operations.

    \item Training and documentation: Store managers and staff will be provided with adequate training and documentation to ensure proper use of the system. Training will be ongoing, and documentation will be updated as needed.

    \item Change management: Changes to the system, including upgrades and modifications, will be managed through a formal change management process. Changes will be tested and validated before implementation.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Constraints}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Budget: The implementation of the instore inventory management system will be subject to budgetary constraints. The cost of hardware, software, and personnel will need to be within the allocated budget.

    \item Integration with existing systems: The system will need to be integrated with the existing point-of-sale (POS) system, which may have limitations on compatibility.

    \item Technical limitations: The system will be subject to technical limitations, such as hardware availability and bandwidth limitations as the system may need to be operated in remote areas where connectivity is scarce.

    \item User adoption: The success of the system will depend on the adoption by store managers and staff. The system will need to be user-friendly and intuitive to ensure adoption.

    \item Regulatory compliance: The system will need to comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, including data privacy and security regulations.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Description of the proposed system \label{Section::Descriptionoftheproposedsystem}}
